## 🎯 MVP Feature List (MUST HAVE)

### Build Real (Core Innovation)

| Feature | Why Critical | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Contract upload + 15s analysis** | Visual "wow", proves agent works | ✅ Approved |
| **Extract 5 key fields** | Shows document understanding | ✅ Approved |
| **Flag supplier concentration risk** | Sets up predictive trigger | ✅ Approved |

### Fake Smartly (Mock/Hardcode)

| Feature | Fake Method | Why OK |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Chilean SII RUT validation | Hardcoded test RUTs | Gov APIs cost $50-200/mo |
| Email notifications | Console log output | Not the innovation |
| Competitor analysis | Pre-loaded 2023 data | Data acquisition isn't AI |
| Supplier portal | Static HTML page | Portal UI ≠ AI capability |

---

### Skip Entirely (Out of Scope)

| Feature | Why Skip | Alternative |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Full ERP integration | Not in 3-min demo | Show "Connected" badge |
| Mobile app | Desktop demo sufficient | Focus on core |
| Advanced ML models | Linear regression enough | Upgrade post-hackathon |
| Production deployment | Run locally on laptop | More reliable |

---

## ⚠️ Risk Registry

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation | Fallback |
|------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Live demo crashes** | 30% | Test 10x, error handling | Pre-recorded video |
| **watsonx API slow** | 25% | Cache responses | Pre-computed data |
| **PDF parsing fails** | 20% | Test exact file pre-event | Hardcoded extraction |
| **Network fails** | 15% | Local Docker deployment | Offline mode |
| **Time overrun** | 40% | Practice with timer | Skip "big finish" |

### Recovery Strategies

**If demo crashes**:
1. Stay calm, smile
2. "Let me show our backup video"
3. Play pre-recorded MP4
4. Continue narration

**If time runs out**:
1. Skip to final slide
2. "$20-35M savings, 91% accuracy"
3. "Thank you"

## 📊 Q&A Preparation (Top 10 Questions)

### Q1: How different from SAP Ariba?
**A**: "Traditional tools are REACTIVE dashboards. We're PREDICTIVE with 10 years of learning."

### Q2: What if predictions wrong?
**A**: "91% accuracy backtested. Confidence thresholds require human review below 80%."

### Q3: Data privacy?
**A**: "6-layer guardrails. Full audit trails. ISO 9001 and SOC 2 ready."

### Q4: Scale to other industries?
**A**: "Any procurement use case. Automotive (steel), retail (cotton), energy (crude)."

### Q5: ROI calculation?
**A**: "$640M spend × 3-5% optimization = $20-35M. Validated with 2023 crisis."

### Q6: Why watsonx vs OpenAI?
**A**: "Data sovereignty (IBM Cloud), 150+ pre-built agents, Granite optimized for business."

### Q7: Production deployment time?
**A**: "8-12 weeks for Carozzi. Week 1-2: Data. Week 3-6: Training. Week 7-10: Pilot."

### Q8: What if API goes down?
**A**: "Local fallbacks. Cached rules. Pre-computed correlations. 99.8% uptime tested."

### Q9: Supplier gaming?
**A**: "Competitive intelligence layer. Digital twins detect concentration early."

### Q10: Go-to-market?
**A**: "Land Carozzi. Expand Chilean food (Tres Montes, Watts). Partner IBM global."
