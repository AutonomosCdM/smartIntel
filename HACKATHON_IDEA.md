# ProcureGenius + Predictive Intelligence

**IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agentic AI Hackathon**
**Team**: Autonomos Lab
**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Status**: IDEA LOCKED ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ THE BIG IDEA

**ProcureGenius** is an AI-powered procurement command center that combines **autonomous multi-agent orchestration** with **predictive risk intelligence** to optimize enterprise procurement operations.

**In One Sentence:**
*"AI agents that negotiate supplier contracts while predicting commodity price impacts using 10 years of historical pattern recognition."*

---

## üí° CORE CONCEPT

### The Problem

Enterprises like Carozzi ($1.566B Chilean food manufacturer) spend $640M annually on procurement but face:
- **Commodity price volatility** (cocoa +50% in 2023 ‚Üí margin compression)
- **Supplier concentration risk** (100% cocoa imports from single region)
- **Manual contract analysis** (lawyers reviewing 100+ page contracts)
- **Reactive decision-making** (no predictive intelligence on price shocks)
- **No historical pattern recognition** (can't learn from past crises)

### The Solution

**Two-Layer AI System:**

#### Layer 1: Autonomous Procurement Agents (ProcureGenius Core)
Multi-agent system that automates end-to-end procurement:
- **Contract Analyst Agent**: Extracts terms, pricing, SLAs from procurement documents
- **Supplier Intelligence Agent**: Analyzes vendor performance, financial health, risk scores
- **Approval Orchestrator Agent**: Auto-approves within policy limits, escalates exceptions
- **Compliance Guardian Agent**: Validates regulatory requirements, flags issues
- **Negotiation Agent**: Proposes optimal contract terms based on market data

#### Layer 2: Predictive Risk Intelligence (Digital Twin Enhancement)
Pattern recognition engine that learns from 10 years of financial history:
- **Historical Pattern Analysis**: Recognizes how company responded to past commodity shocks
- **Correlation Detection**: Maps external events (wheat price surge, peso devaluation) ‚Üí financial impact
- **Predictive Scenarios**: Simulates future shocks ("What if cocoa rises 30%?")
- **Risk Scoring**: Real-time alerts on supplier/commodity concentration risks
- **Backtesting Validation**: Proves accuracy by predicting known historical outcomes

---

## üõ°Ô∏è GUARDRAILS & GOVERNANCE

**Critical for Enterprise Trust**: Multi-layered control system ensures AI operates within human-defined boundaries.

### 1. Financial Approval Thresholds

**Auto-Approval Limits** (Carozzi-specific):

| Contract Value | Approval Required | Processing Time |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| < $50K | Contract Analyst Agent only | Auto-approved (2 min) |
| $50K - $500K | Approval Orchestrator + Manager review | 4-6 hours |
| $500K - $5M | Approval Orchestrator + Director + Risk Committee | 24-48 hours |
| > $5M | Board approval required | System flags, blocks auto-processing |

**Rationale**: Prevents runaway automation on high-value contracts while accelerating low-risk approvals.

### 2. Supplier Concentration Guardrails

**Risk Concentration Rules**:

| Condition | Risk Level | System Action |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Single supplier > 60% of commodity | üî¥ HIGH RISK | Block new contracts, require diversification plan |
| Single supplier 40-60% | üü° MEDIUM RISK | Allow with mandatory mitigation plan |
| Geographic concentration > 70% | üî¥ HIGH RISK | Force multi-region sourcing |
| New supplier (no history) | ‚ö†Ô∏è UNKNOWN | Manual approval only, no auto-processing |

**Real Example**: Carozzi's 100% cocoa import from West Africa ‚Üí System would immediately flag üî¥ and block additional contracts until diversification strategy is approved.

### 3. Compliance Validation Layer

**Chilean Regulatory Requirements**:

| Regulation | Check Performed | Failure Action |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Ley 20.393 (Anti-bribery) | Supplier background verification | Block contract, escalate to compliance team |
| Ley 19.496 (Consumer protection) | Contract terms validation | Flag unfair clauses, suggest revisions |
| Tax compliance | Verify supplier RUT (tax ID) | Reject if invalid or non-compliant |
| Labor regulations | Fair labor practices check | Flag violations, require certification |
| Environmental regulations | Validate ISO 14001 or equivalent | Warning for high-impact commodities |

**Automation**: Compliance Guardian Agent runs **all checks in parallel** (15 seconds total) before any contract proceeds.

### 4. Predictive Alert Thresholds

**Prediction Confidence Guardrails**:

| Confidence Level | System Action | Example |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| > 80% confidence | Auto-trigger hedging recommendation | "Cocoa spike 85% likely ‚Üí Hedge 30% of exposure" |
| 60-80% confidence | Alert CFO, suggest scenario planning | "Wheat volatility 72% likely ‚Üí Monitor for 2 weeks" |
| 40-60% confidence | Monitor only, no action | "Vegetable oil fluctuation 55% likely ‚Üí Track" |
| < 40% confidence | Don't display prediction | Insufficient historical data |

**Backtesting Requirement**: Predictions must achieve >75% accuracy on historical test set before activation.

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop Triggers

**Mandatory Escalation Points**:

- Contract value > $5M
- Supplier concentration > 60%
- Prediction confidence < 60%
- Compliance violation detected
- New commodity category (no historical data)
- Geopolitical risk alert (e.g., trade war)

**Escalation Flow**:
```
AI Detection ‚Üí Risk Assessment ‚Üí Human Review ‚Üí Decision ‚Üí Execution
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì               ‚Üì              ‚Üì          ‚Üì
  15 sec         2 min          4-24 hrs      Immediate   Auto
```

### 6. Audit Trail & Explainability

**Every Decision Logged**:
- Timestamp
- Agent(s) involved
- Data sources consulted
- Confidence scores
- Risk flags raised
- Human approver (if applicable)
- Final outcome

**Regulatory Compliance**: Full audit trail for ISO 9001, SOC 2, and financial audits.
